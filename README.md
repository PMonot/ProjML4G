By Louis Beaudouing, Pierre Monot, Amine Ait Benmessaoud

This Repository's purpose is to explain and propose a practical simulation of the algorithms presented in the following article :

"Opinion Shaping in Social Networks Using Reinforcement Learning" By Vivek S. Borkar, Alexandre Reiffers-Masson, 
published in IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON CONTROL OF NETWORK SYSTEMS, VOL. 9, NO. 3, SEPTEMBER 2022 p1305-1316

This repostiory contains: 
- A jupyter notebook ProjML4G.ipynb, with the main workflow and explainations. 
- A python file code_generation_graph, with different functions to create simulations of graphs and to represent it.
- A python file utils, used to store different functions used in the workflow.
